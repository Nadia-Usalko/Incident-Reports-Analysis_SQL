Someone else’s underwear underneath the drawers in the closet| 

Ordered 3 romance packages (and paid for them) yet one was refunded bcuz they were oversold but never even notified us.|

Ran out of bubbly very quickly at the sail away party before we could even get a single glass of it to celebrate - we had been told previously that it would be served through the entire sail away party|

All fitness classes were completely sold out within hours - there really needs to be more options so others can also join|

Safety video was difficult to load and had to watch it multiple times before we got the option to confirm we have completed it - and even after that, it still shows as incomplete|

Shake for champagne did not work for several of our crew and customer service just responded to call room service to have it delivered but we shouldn’t have to be in our room - we were told we could order anywhere on the ship|

While off the ship in Key West on cellular, we could not access details of our trip in the app. Before the trip, we weren’t required to be on the ship’s WiFi (obviously) but once the cruise began, they only way we could access our account for information is to be on ship’s WiFi but that isn’t possible in Key West.|

Many of these things were marketed to us as to how VV is better than other cruise lines but it just makes VV seem worse than other cruise ships if they don’t work - bcuz it’s a high expectation that then becomes a frustrating disappointment.|

At the Festival Stage Acts the first night at the manor - we tried to order drinks at the bar and they told us we had to order at our table. It took forever for someone to come by to take drink orders and then she was a complete jerk when we were asking about the different drinks. I finally just told her forget it, just bring us water.|

Wake brunch was a disappointing experience - especially since we were there to celebrate several birthdays. The server we had (Giovani) never introduced himself and said “no” multiple times…asked for the full menu - no, asked for croissants - no. Didn’t get our first round of mimosas until the food started coming and didn’t get a refill until we were done eating. About 1/2 way through our meal, Giovani completely disappeared. Other staff served us through the rest of the meal but never metjoned or explained why our original server disappeared.""","Sailor was assured her feedback will be noted, so our leadership team can review it and take appropriate steps in order to improve the experience in the future.

Overall service was great and food quality for the most part was amazing. For the negative our cabin has constant creaking sound almost as if we were on board an old wooden ship. Though I understand this cruise is more on the ""party"" side, I was hoping there were dedicated relaxing areas (besides the spa) on the ship. Though there appears to be, it is ruined by the constant loud music at every corner of the vessel. It also makes it difficult to carry a conversation such as when at the pizza parlor. Razzel Dazzel was in line with the online comments I've read regarding sub par customer service. Which was odd because at Pink Agave was among the best I've had on any cruise line. The food there was also ""meh"" in comparison to food elsewhere on the ship. The main performances are only scheduled once rather than twice a night like other cruises which makes it even more difficult to schedule dining (its hard enough as it is). Lastly the ship layout is odd. I feel at times like I'm going through a corn maze. I've never seen anywhere where the men's and ladies bathroom are at opposite ends. I truly don't get the logic there and why areas are hard to get to/hidden throughout. I feel that for the most part there things can be easily fixed with training.

Starting from dining the Sailor shared there is just no priority at all, she was expecting that upon arriving in the restaurants there would be a line or even a sign to let them know they are checking-in the right place for Rockstars, but just keeping it free for them to jump in front of the line and push over to be checked-in is just embarrassing. The Sailor mentioned we can fix it easily with a sign or a person to be guiding the Sailors right there. She had spoken to several people that agreed with her (about 15 Sailors) and some mentioned they are just not using this “perk” as it makes no sense.  Regarding the prioritized access to bookable events, the Sailor reported again that it is inexistent. All events she attended to at the Red Room and The Manor, none of the staff offered them priority, took them from the line or even allowed them to go first. The Sailor mentioned she asked a couple of times if Rockstars shouldn’t enter first for the events to which she was told no.  The Sailor also brought to RSM’s attention how is the service in Bimini, and according to her words it is a “joke”. There is no secluded area for the Rockstars apart from the 8-9 am window. Sailor mentioned she noticed that is the time where managers are around, so it works. But from when they leave till the end of the day, any Sailor with a red band can use the Retreat area as there is no control from the beach area. Sailors shared on how other Sailors with a red band were saying “oh we will stay here as they don’t care”, “we were told by security no one comes here to check”, “there are no umbrellas on that side so we were told we could stay here”. The Sailor indeed reported yesterday a big group of red bands Sailors smoking and making noise, but according to her it took too long for someone to show up.  She informed RSM that she is a travel agent and now she cannot sell us anymore for the Rockstars quarters. There is just no value for money if we don’t polish the services and the points she brought to our attention. She mentioned this same feedback is coming from her clients as well, and she really wants us to develop as it’s good for both sides. The Sailor is coming back on March 6th in a Sea Terrace to compare services.  RSM extended apologies for the Sailors and clarified to her how the perks go for dining and bookable events, the Sailor was understanding and very polite, however, she advised that it just never happed to her or to any Rockstar she spoke with.  RSM thanked her for her feedback and offered $200 FVC as they are coming back in a few weeks. RSM advised he will follow up with the team in regard to the bookable events priority and escalate her feedback about dining priority. The Sailors were very thankful. "

She didn't even check if anything was available or suggest we look in the app or even point us towards the dock or a different food venue. I'm definitely not expecting people to recognize us but the reason we walked down to The Wake was because we saw reservation at 12:30pm available and we didn't think it was a big deal to walk into the restaurant. I would probably have said something even if we was sailing on an inside cabin, Technically she wasn't rude, just unhelpful and unfriendly.""

Valentina (Sommelier) who is the supervisor onboard during the Bimini operation went to meet the sailors who advised the bartender in Aquatic had been rude. Valentina advised the sailors that it was very out of character with the bartender and that they had been under a lot of pressure and would not intentionally be rude to a sailor. Sailors accepted this noting that it had been quite busy. Valentina assured the sailors it would be followed up with the crew member.  ,"I followed up with the crew member (Laras). Laras explained that she was very busy and the sailors were undecided about what they wanted to drink and two requests they had were not onboard. She was trying to stay engaged with the sailors while serving other sailors to not have a line build-up since she was alone due to all the other crew being on the island. Laras said that at one point she turned to another sailor to confirm an order and when she turned back Scott had moved away from the counter and Stephanie turned and addressed the crew member quite rudely saying ""Thank You"" but in a loud and sarcastic tone which made Laras feel upset as she had been trying to assist everyone by herself. ",Sailors seem content with Valentina's follow up however logging the crew members' side of this interaction in case of further escalation as the crew member was indeed very busy when we checked sales for the period.

Knowing we booked this cruise last minute (due to personal schedule) we haven’t been able to make any dinner reservations. We had success one night to make a “waiting list” at razzle dazzle, but were told by every other restaurant that they were booked for the week. This is unacceptable for the money paid and the experience that’s advertised.  It has made dinner a stress and unenjoyable.

I’ve sailed on Norwegian three times and it was some of the most relaxing trips I’ve ever had.  I had nothing but complete stress the first two hours I was on this ship due to your technology failures. There is no way that you don’t know that this is an issue because your app rates 1.6 in the App Store. Everyone hates it.  At this point in my sailing I would never book Virgin again. I seriously hope conditions approve because I paid a lot of money for this vacation and so far it has been a complete disappointment. I considered getting off the ship before it left Miami because I was so stressed out.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: 1. We paid extra money for a sea terrace XL but these rooms don’t have the glass front to see the ocean, so I sit on my balcony and stare at a wall of metal. 
2. The rooms are RIGHT next to the mechanical room both next us and below us so we hear banging and loud noises-enough to wake you up from a dead sleep or keep you from sleeping. HORRIBLE ROOMS-and we paid MORE for them! I’m just so disappointed with them.
3. One of our rooms hadn’t been cleaned properly at all’s hair tie left in the shower from the previous people are no hand soap either. I had to track someone down no less than 4 times on our arrival day for different reasons and then had to call that night because the pillows I had asked for never arrived. 
4. The app has been terrible this trip. Wouldn’t work AT ALL the entire time we were in Miami so by the time it started working, tons of things were already sold outs so we had no opportunity to attend several things we had anticipated being able to enjoy while on the cruise. 
5. Many of the restrooms around the ship either had no toilet paper or were out of hand soap or the sinks didn’t work. 
6. There was no drag queen bingo onboard, which was our favorite activity from the last cruise. Not being able to see the lineup before you book just doesn’t sit will with me. Had I known this particular cruise was going to be all poker tournaments and no drag queen bingo, I never would have purchased this particular cruise. 
Overall-we LOVED our first cruise and couldn’t wait to get back on for our second cruise. After this one, I doubt that we will voyage again With VV. There are too many other cruise lines to try and this one just made us realize that so many others have better things to offer and have a higher level of customer service.

This is my third virgin cruise in two years. We’ve loved the first two so much that we’ve gifted future sailing vouchers to our family and friends to experience it themselves. More over, for my moms 60th birthday celebration, I saved up to take her on one this weekend. Unfortunately, if this trip had been my first virgin voyage, it would be my last. My mom gets motion sickness and is a light sleeper, and I told her that this ship would be great because it’s quiet and you don’t feel the motion. I wasn’t afforded an option to purchase a central terrace during booking and this was our only weekend we were available to go. Once receiving our room number I panicked. I was worried about the back of the ship and 8th floor for motion and the noise from the entertainment below so I tried to level upgrade to at least a larger room on a higher floor. By the time I received the room location, our flights were booked and my mom was ecstatic to finally take her first real vacation in years. So I decided to stay quiet and hope for the best. But regardless of that, for the price I paid to treat my mom, i have been embarrassed all weekend long by all of the things i had experienced in the past that i knew she would love and appreciate. I want to start by saying the crew, per usual has been amazing. David has tended to our every need. When We got in on day one, our cabin carpet was stained likely from a previous sailor spilling food in drips, the mirror and cabinet in cabin has residue smears, the people who stayed before us tore up wall and cabinets, the lights on the wall were hanging down from the wall (I fixed). Our bed wall panel vibrated so loud with the ship movement (I have a video) that we couldn’t sleep in night one. I’m a big planner, and this itinerary was chosen because I had done it before and never had a problem feeling the ship move. Unfortunately, at the back of the ship even I have felt it and my poor mother does too. To add to my embarrassment, the music blaring from directly under our room in the Dock or the karaoke each night. I understand that this is fun for everyone but we haven’t been able to sleep before midnight any of the nights. My mom has been an angel telling me that it’s no big deal, but I know that it’s because I’ve paid for the entire trip and she doesn’t want me to feel badly. If I had known at time of purchase that our cabin location would be where it was, I would not have booked this trip. This is all to say I really believe it could be beneficial to your future sailors to have the option to select their room if they aren’t doing a lock it in rate. I hope that this feedback proves beneficial. And if not, thanks for taking the time to read it anyway. Also, the internet is the worst it’s ever been. My network is consistently not working or able to connect to the app.""","02/24/24 09:14 HDA AI : Sailors are ready to move to new cabin , HDA made sure the new cabin is ready and sent housekeeping to assist them with luggage, they are moved in MXP and in new cabin.","02/24/24 09:14 HDA AI : Sailors are ready to move to new cabin , HDA made sure the new cabin is ready and sent housekeeping to assist them with luggage, they are moved in MXP and in new cabin."

Dinner courses were delivered without clearing previous courses.  
Staff does not seem to possess ""situational awareness""
of the pacing of the dinner and just delivers whatever comes from the kitchen, without considering whether the previous course is completed.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: The romance package was misleading with the shake for champagne. Until we got on board we assumed you got champagne at any time each day. The treats only served on last 2 nights? We wanted our romance to start right away. The dinners were excellent food was great. The last night we scheduled as our special night. The only time we could do a show that was available was 10 pm and yep at 9 it was cancelled. No option to rebook as it was the last night. We the shows “selling” out this was very disappointing. The ap is awful. From day one of download through the entire cruise and when we asked about it we got a “yes, we know but it gets better when we are out at sea” well that’s a nope it doesn’t! Also telling us the are washing balconies during the cruise at 9:30 am was disappointing for us as we were going to sleep in that day since our tour was 2:30pm. Individually this issues were things you could overlook but all together made for a disappointing cruise.

Just wanted to inform you about a sailor who did not want to turn over her prohibited item (Steamer).

Sailor insisted she went over the prohibited item list and the steamer was not on there. While the word ""steamer"" is not on there, it does say ""Any appliance with a heating body or element"". Although she was very upset about this, she later understood after explaining that it is a fire hazard.

Vazquez claims she waited over an hour for an answer on this prohibited item. I spoke to security about why it took so long to get assistance when I was available. They said they called their supervisor and then Ship security for assistance. I asked them to please contact me next time as well to expedite the response.

Vazquez also mentioned she has a very short window to make her flight on disembarkation day. She will be very upset if she misses her flight when trying to claim her item again.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: Overall, and my first experience of cruising, I don’t think I have been delighted with it. 

- breakfast wasn’t fantastic and didn’t quite know what was happening. I requested several items from the waitress, and they either came incorrect, or not what I ordered.
- on deck 16, during the day, the music was too loud and wasn’t offered a drink at all. Instead, had to go down to deck 15 every time I wanted a drink. 
- issues with credit card, despite being uploaded in advance and checked at checkin. When asked at Sailor Services, the colleague had no clue as to what it could be. 
- went to Razzle Dazzle last night, and was completely lost with the menu. Didn’t know what was happening, or what was supposed to be received. Very little explanation on the menu, and it was just confusing overall - we were sitting on a table and all three tables to the right of us sent one course back, at least, for not liking it!!
- the general ‘attentiveness’ of service is not fantastic. For example, was in the Sip lounge, and had to wait 15 minutes for someone to take the order and that was only after calling someone over. Another example is the room wasn’t cleaned until c.midday. 

I recognise that, maybe, my expectations are not quite right. I, several times a year, stay in Virgin Limited Edition hotels, and having stayed in most of these, they different vastly from a virgin voyage - I wasn’t expecting this, as it is part of the wider ‘virgin group’ but recognise that, maybe, I shouldn’t compare.

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: Unfortunately for me I sailed on Valiant Lady in 2023 Nov. Pink Agavae was a highly recognised food venue and it lived up to my expectations ..But here on Scarlet they failed miserably. Although our staff was nice. The food was just not well prepared, it wasmt freshly prepared or hot...(luke warm at best) There just seemed to be too much going on with wayyyy to many staff moving around at the same time. I understand being busy and all. But we actually waited a very long time for our main course entree's, very tight seating arrangements the back of my chair was right by a supporting column which was also a high trafficked pass through and the back of my chair was bumped several times by patrons and staff. I applaude Pink Agave for attempting to accomodate guest but there were sooo many other spaces that had no activity at all that couldve been used to ""spread people out"" more. I also loved the musical vibe but the DJ just played it a bit too loud which caused diners to have raise our voices and people were basically talking over each other so that they could be heard

I was told I could file complaints here. Uhm. I don’t want to be that person, but I’ve interacted with Amin (the Hype) (Scarlet Lady) on the entertainment team multiple times on this voyage and he’s been awesome! But we interacted today after his dancing set on Bimini and he just made me uncomfortable. I’m an adult, but I’m 19– he knows this. He asked multiple times if he could see my tits and if I was a virgin and if I wanted to practice sex on the beach with him. He also pressed and asked if I sold nude pictures or if he could have them. He told my friend he was obsessed with me and in love with me. Which is fine. I’m not that distressed. It made me uncomfortable. But if y’all could just tell him— not to do that to others? He assured me he was joking but I don’t want the same thing to happen to others.

That is not how you portrayed walk in dining. The beds are not comfortable. I Have gotten undercooked meals, bad service, and just a lack of service from some of the staff. The way you swap from breakfast to lunch is ignorant and not organized. This has not been a very appealing cruise and probably wouldn’t go on another one nor recommend to a friend. The resort we went to in Cozumel was littered with kids and the kayaks and snorkeling just not what was portrayed on the advertisement. Why does someone having type 2 diabetes that is controlled a problem to go “snorkeling” which was just swimming in shallow water with a life vest and a snorkel. Our original cruise was cancelled abruptly due to lack of planning on Yal part. Directions on the ship are horrible and very confusing due to the lack of signs. This has just not been a great trip for me and my wife. I had great service by a couple of your bartenders but other than that not so good.

RSA asked for RSM to meet with the Sailor. RSM checked that AIMS were still open and called Carpenter on Duty, who advised that both problems can only be fixed tomorrow morning as the silicone gasket needs to be replaced, at this time he had an emergency at Deck 15 Mega suite to attend to without an estimated time to finish. RSM informed that this has become an emergency as the Sailor has an aggravated mood.

RSA was with sailors at the time and met Jared about 15 minutes after the last message from SS. RSA met Jared in the suite and he was visibly upset and stated the shower still leaks and the balcony door makes a screeching noise and hard to open it. He stated he reported the shower door in the morning to CH and a carpenter came but didn't fix the door. He mentioned the balcony door was making a noise but was not at that time. RSA apologised for the delay and called the carpenter on duty right away to come and assist in the suite. Carpenter came and had flipped a panel on the balcony door which made it easier to open but still made a screeching noise. Carpenter assessed the shower door and stated the rubber needed to be replaced. He received a call while he was assessing the shower door and stated he has to rush somewhere for an emergency and will have to fix the door in the morning. Upon hearing this Jared got more upset and stated he used his hard earned money to pay for this suite which cost him $9000 and should be prioritized as he is a VIP. RSA calmed Jared down and assured him both doors would be fixed by that evening. RSA contacted RSM to contact Carpenter to send someone to assist with both shower door and balcony door. Jared was getting irate at waiting for someone to come to the suite and started to speak loudly and stating he's not dramatic or high maintenance. CH and ACH came to the suite as Jared had seen them in the hallway and asked them if he did not report this in the morning. Jared demanded for CH to call his supervisor to come to the suite. DM came to the suite to talk with Jared, Jared was explaining his frustration towards not having the doors fixed and thought DM was laughing at him, RSA stated he's not laughing, Jared asked what is DM smiling about then, does DM think this is funny or a joke. RSA stated there seems to be a misunderstanding but jared ignored RSA and shouted that DM must leave his suite immediately. DM tried to calm Jared down but he was getting more aggravated and stated ""If he does not leave, I will start swinging."" RSA asked DM to leave the suite to avoid physical conflict. RSA called RSM to come to the suite as Jared had asked for RSM, DM was waiting outside the suite at this time along with CH. Jared saw that DM was outside the suite and shouted he doesn't want him anywhere near his suite and doesn't want to see him, DM left.

We spent the entire day mostly on the open-air truck ride to and from the location, only rode the ATVs 20 minutes, and was told we had to wait before and after riding because they didn’t have enough ATVs. There were almost 50 people signed up and they only had 16 ATVs so they divided the group by 3, they did this coin toss process to determine who had to sit around and wait. We left the port late, so everything thereafter seemed rushed. We were last to head back to the port and initially it seemed we wouldn’t make it back in time because we had to wait for group 3 to ride the ATVs and stop by a woman’s house for a few minutes for an espresso. Also, the helmets for our heads were not thoroughly cleaned and disinfected between users which exposes each people to communicable diseases and germs. I watched as people were directed off and on the ATVs, likely due to tight schedule, and a guy walked by and randomly sprayed a little Lysol inside, which is not supposed to go on things that we wear on our bodies, and did not attempt to clean the eye covering. On the truck ride back, we got stuck on the dirt road because cars and people attending a funeral blocked the road, so we were just sitting waiting and then the truck ran over a motorcycle which was stuck under the truck. Some local people got it out. There was absolutely no cellular reception so there was no way to alert the ship as to our location or what was happening.

Almost every meal had been served cold.

The clientele leaves little to be desired (though I realize this isn’t some the company can control). The fact there were swingers at the PJ party nearly having sex on the lounger my friends & I (and others) were on with crew walking by without saying anything is disgusting. 

Sadly, I’m an avid cruiser but will not sail with VV again. This has been a huge waste of money & loss of vacation time. I do believe the company should do some better marketing to allow those of us who might be considered “prudes” a better idea of how to set expectations.

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: This rating is about the Horserace painting/Ali the Artist, but there was no category for that so this was the closest. We’ve done the seahorse race multiple times before and both times with Ali have been subpar and awkward experiences especially compared with other Happenings Cast interactions. She has a standoff demeanor and makes it seem like the Sailors are inconveniencing her scheduled. Every other race we’ve done, the artist has offered two sessions or at least one two hour session. Here we were offered one one-hour session or to be sat on the side of a separate event. While I know this isn’t a directed session, other artists have made themselves available, offered some input and suggestions, or at least had fun and positive interactions during the session. She also maintained more of an authoritarian attitude during the painting and racing session than lighthearted fun. While our group wasn’t impacted, one group was a little late for the race coming from Drag Bingo and they were only afforded a few minutes to arrive (we were also told we could be a few mins late while the mock race was completed), yet the mock race and intros took close to 30 minutes. We’ve had very positive connections with other Happenings cast members over our 11 Virgin Voyages but Ali doesn’t seem to invite those interactions.

Of course there are exceptions but this now seems to be the norm. I have always raved about the food. Now not so much. Again, as the ships have gotten more towards capacity at sailings, your attempt to make it more efficient, you've made it feel like other cruiselines. The galley use to feel special in itself that you could walk around and view what selections were available, then sit down and be waited in. Now, while convenient and probably quicker, you stand in line, tell them what you want, and they prepare it and hand it to you when ready. New take on buffet. Then I made a reservation at the test kitchen after looking at the menu on the app for that evening only to get there and be told that that menu wasn't available until two days from then. I had tried this particular menu before and did not like it. So I was very disappointed. I would not have booked had I known. You also changed the menu at Razzle Dazzle. While there are those who like smoked flavor, it is an acquired taste. A few items are fine but it seemed that since it's in vogue, you want to make it the main flavor for most of the dishes. Smoked flavored cream burlee. Seriously! Next, you used to have excellent shows. Different, but that's what made them special. Now it seems like very little effort it put into them. I am so sorry that I sound so negative, but I loved everything about the Virgin Voyages Brand. So seeing you become more and more mainstream is disappointing. I loved how special I felt rather I was in a regular cabin or suite. I understand business, profit and stakeholders, but please don't forget Richard Brandon's vision for a casual luxury sustainable cruiseline.

I was given a locker and no other instructions. I was traveling with a friend and she had our bar credits on her wrist thing so if I wasn’t with her I couldn’t drink and Tuesday night mine wasn’t even charged to hers it was charged to mine. This was not the cruise for me I guess. I thought having no kids would be great and relaxing but instead it was a frat party for four days. We went to the Test Kitchen for dinner. I’d have to say the worst meal ever. I didn’t stay for the entire thing. On the app what the menu was advertised was not what was served. I dont eat fish and my only other option was lamb which I don’t like. The app menu said it was beef. It was very uncomfortable for me. I realize the manager of the test kitchen was trying to help but I was insulted. He came to the table and said maybe this wasn’t for me and I could go to another restaurant. I say maybe if you had the right menu this wouldn’t have happened. Our cabin steward was wonderful as well as our server at pink agave. The one thing I was really hoping to do was the bungie workout. I tried to sign up as soon as I boarded at 2:00 and all the slots were already full.

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: There are too many bars on this ship and not enough quality restaurants.  We’ve been on many cruises, however this is the first Virgin cruise we’ve taken .. We SMELLED VOMIT on numerous occasions walking through the ship .  Obviously from people vomiting alcohol from being drunk .  The fact there are NO quality restaurants without making a reservation is unacceptable for us .  We could not get a reservation due to all of them being sold out nightly.  We felt ripped off quite frankly . You advertise Virgin as a higher quality experience but in reality you are actually sailing a floating bar so that you can bring in extra very lucrative bar bucks! You seriously need to rework the entire experience. Yes bars are fine but quality (and available) meals and entertainment are also an important part of the overall cruising experience. The hype on the scarlet night experience was a total disappointment.  We attended .. wore red and felt the whole experience was a bar crawl that was a total bore .  Dancing was minimal what we saw and we left .  The wedding was a bit strange . Some of the crew members were not trained in that realm and whole thing was amateur.  Disappointment is what best describes our experience on this ship .

He also stated that this voyage is the worst he's been on. Last week he was in 13011A and enjoyed his voyage but stated he didn't like his CH as the suite was dirty and there was hair in the bathroom from previous sailors that stayed in the suite. RSA commented with surprise as he didn't mention the suite was dirty or hair in the bathroom to anyone. He stated that he didn't have any issues on his last voyage but this time there are a lot of issues especially with the food. At the Galley the servers will wipe down the counter and hand food to sailors without changing their gloves which will cause cross contamination. He was served raw chicken from the Diner and Dash and when he spoke to the Chef he didn't seem to be bothered and fried another batch of chicken wings in 3 minutes, which he stated that chicken wings take 7 minutes to cook, he would know as he owns a restaurant. The food at SE has  been cold and arrives late. The steak at The Wake was overcooked , he had asked for medium. The sanitizers' around the ship are not working and addressed AEH as he had mentioned the ones on Deck 6 & 7 were empty or not working, the Midship and Forward sanitizers' on Deck 12 by the elevators were not working as. AEH  stated that she called the electrician to fix the sensor and he stated its not working, SSD, AEH, RSA and Jared went to the Forward elevator to check the sanitizer and it was working.

Room service is always booked as is this dining situation you have on this ship .  The food in the food court set up you have is below average from our experiences of dining on other ships.   When we wake up and can’t get a hot cup of coffee without having to purchase it at that coffee bar ..  it’s very annoying .  Last night we had reservations in Gunbae…  but we refuse to sit in group sitting so we left .  The fact that we pay high prices then are forced to sit with other passengers to dine is unfair .  We are non drinkers . Bring forced to sit with other passengers that are drinking heavily is not what we expect from booking this cruise .  We had to eat the Chinese food in the food court and the selection is pitiful and the sweet and sour chicken was slimy and gross .

Must admit our final day on board was the best and if the entire experience had been at this level my opinion of Virgin Voyages would be very good, but unfortunately the first 3 days did not meet expectations. The Wake restaurant was however fantastic! Both the service and food were exceptional! If we had been able to get reservations at other restaurants onboard I think our opinion of the overall voyage might be completely different. The availability of seating in restaurants is wholly inadequate and needs to be addressed in the worst way. The food quality in the Galley is very institutional, and poor quality. Staff were helpful but this did not overcome the poor food quality. I know you have the ability to create quality food, I fount this at the Wake.

Shortly after, I`ve seen message from the SERV SAFE group that she has been pointed out there too. Mrs. Ashley Neff did not start playing rather than socializing around her husband`s table, but occasionally I could see that she is “wobbly”, and that she is not able to keep balance when standing. Occasionally I could overhear swear words too that were addressed to her husband or to the other gentleman. I have alerted the Casino Supervisors of her state and I have advised them to pay attention to the table in case she needs assistance. Soon after, Mrs. Ashley Neff sat down next to her husband, and I could hear that she calls him M…. r F…. r. I double checked if everything is fine with them, and I asked them if they would require any assistance to be escorted to the room later.

Booked excursion for Parafise Island today. Got to meet area & the port staff told us our group was there way too early & Virgin Voyages had messed up. It took me literally tapping this person on the shoulder because he was very frustrated & on cell say no bueno virgin voyages over & over to so.Many sailors were waiting to here what was happening and he wasn’t answering. Then NIKOS who was very kind, explained the situation in detail. Nikos explained the tour would now leave at 230 instead of 1230 and back on ship at 730. We had reservations with friends book for a show & dinner so we couldn’t make that change. He said we would be refunded.Refunded isn’t enough really.can’t go to spa, reservations taken for food options today. Poolboacked when we came back to ship.have a torn meniscus so booked excursion that would pickup close to boat & drop back off & planned to take closest beach chair to drop off. Walking in Cozumel not an option. All or her excursions booked up. Basically very frustrated with this outcome & have a disappointed daughter whose trip this was for her 19th birthday. She begged for a virgin voyage. This is my 23rd cruise. I’ve never had an excursion fiasco like this one on any of my previous cruises. The whole thing was just really ODD & heartbreaking! Wish it would have been different & Cozumel would have beendoable at paradise beach excursion. Just wanted sailor services to know so they can work on this mix up & the next sailors won’t have to miss a day of cruising to a logistical mistake oneithervirfin or the excursion b.

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: We loved Duel Reality!!!!  I gave sad face because we would have liked to go to Red Party events tonight but our excursion was delayed, and instead of a “comfortable bus” we travelled to Chichen Itza and back in an INCREDIBLY cramped and uncomfortable van.  We were rushed through the excursion once we arrived because of the delay in starting, we didn’t even get to see the giant stone head ruin that is pictured on the advertisement.  It definitely was not worth the high price we paid and we lost an entire day of fun because we chose that excursion.  I couldn’t be more disappointed with how today went and now we are exhausted.  Why make the party on the same day as excursions are scheduled?  Very poor planning on Virgin’s part.  So we decided to stay in the cabin and order food which has been a fiasco.  First, the app would not work.  After much effort, we finally got ahold of room service through phone and learned that we can’t get fries with a burger and can’t get a real margarita on the rocks, only canned.  Very frustrating.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: See sailor services complaint made at 120PM today. Excursion scheduled for Parafise island. Told when we met at appropriate spot that Virgin had made a mistake with vendor not telling us anything instead say virgin no bueno on cell phone over & over. Nikos cane to speak to group for excursion stating the tour would now leave at 230 & return at 730. We’d made dinner & show plans with friends so we couldn’t take that option. A refund was made but I sent to sailor services a refund isn’t enough I put on & took swim attire & all other excursions were booked. So couldn’t really do what we wanted on shore. Said to sailor services I had a knee problem so walking is difficult. Choose swim excursion so a boat was taking me & I could sit the whole day. Instead I got back to full pools. No reservations & no way to change all the plans made for day from 1130-600. Sailor services sent back forwarded to excursion group but zero contact from them & a notification sailor services thread was closed. As I said I my chat to them: never have I had a go fused vendor & an excursion group who basically believe it was messed up - too bad so sorry. Har lived this cruise until today.

This is their first voyage with us and they expressed that our delivery has not met their expectations. Some items were promised to be in their cabin but did not arrive until the second day, they asked their rockstar agent about swapping their entire minibar for malibu and were met with just a no and no real discussion. They said service has been ok but they have received better and in general just feel like they have had better experiences on other cruise lines. Adding the missed port and changed itinerary has just been an added frustration.","At 16:30 RSM met with both Sailors. RSM listened carefully to all their comments and feedback. Sailors started by embarkation where they felt a little lost not knowing who to reach out to and ended up waiting for about 1h for their RSA to speak with them, the Sailors mentioned they noticed she was busy with other Sailors in a big group, but they were the last ones she spoke with. Then they requested their liquor to be swapped for Malibu rum as it's the only thing that Kenneth drinks, but they were told no, we could only swap for the options already in the mini bar. Sailor then asked for a fresh coconut, to attempt to do his own coconut rum, but never received it. He mentioned it could even be canned as the RSA mentioned to him, but still it never came. They also requested for 80's Rock vinyls but received different albums that they didn't like. Adding to that, the Sailors mentioned the itinerary change, however, were understanding this is out of our powers. Sailor Kenneth also brought up on how he thought RSA would be his outmost resource when asking for things like the bottle of Malibu, but then he met BOM that confirmed this could actually be done. When they got back to the suite, they noticed the bottle of Malibu placed however the wines were gone. Sailor Brenda mentioned she is the one that likes the wine, so that was a bad impression for them as well. The last drop was when they were charged for the Sea Day being booked for a Port Day, they messaged their RSA saying they wanted to cancel that, however, RSA informed them there would be a cancellation fee. Sailor Branda mentioned she became very angry, but RSA made up for it by going to their suite and explaining she understood they wanted to cancel and not that they were mistakenly chaged. Sailor confirmed RSA took care of it very quickly after they spoke, however, they felt this could have been avoided if RSA anticipated the mistake. RSM extended apologies and clarified out mini bar policy to the Sailor, again it was restated to them that RSA followed the procedure, however, BOM in an attempt of making them hapier, authorized the exception of having the Malibu bottle in exchange for all the mini bar in the suite. RSM also explained that the SPA moved appointments from the port day to the next day of the voyage and vice versa, the Sailors were understanding. RSM put himself available for all requests they may have and assured they can contact him whenever they feel unsatisfied with anything onboard. The Sailor appreciated the chat a lot and mentioned they already booked a future voyage in VAL. Sailors also mentioned it was Brenda's first voyage with VV so they had high expectations for it. In the end Sailors said they are enjoying anyways and they are not big complainers. RSM appreciated the Sailors feedback.",RSM followed with RSA and new albuns were sent to the suite as they didn't like the previous. Bottle of red wine placed in the suite with anniversary setup. Nothing further.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: I have been unable to book any dinner reservations starting from about 5 weeks before the cruise until today.  I am with a group and they invited me to dinner with them tonight, otherwise I was told nothing is available at all.  I went to the pink agave about 1:15 pm today since the hours for making dinner reservations was 9-2 I was surprised no one was there.  I asked sailor services and they were unable to make any reservations, or provide any assistance at all.  have tried to walk in both nights of the cruise at multiple restaurants and was never called from the waiting list.  Your website and app say there is always tables left open for walk ins, this isn’t true.   The hostess at the Italian restaurant was very rude when I asked about reservations and told me there was never any time available.  It’s frustrating to the point that I considered flying home from Nassau tomorrow and would have done so but for the tour group I am with inviting me to dinner tonight.  On the first day of the cruise I waited in the reservation line for about 30 minutes before giving up.  Your process for dining in the restaurants is convoluted and difficult to navigate.   I am on a full comp from the casino and find the lack of assistance from anyone but my tour group to be zero.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: We won’t be booking Virgin again, and considering that many of our followers have expressed similar experiences we feel that this is nothing unique to us. We understand that emergencies may cause changes. But when a customer comes to you with questions about how these questions will affect their visa and you tell them that you’ll get back to them by a certain time, you get back to them. You don’t keep pushing them off and ignoring them, that’s just customer service 101. It’s sad because everything else has been amazing, but the customer service standards at Sailor Services fails on ever level. We’ve wasted over $10k on this cruise simply because no one would answer our questions about my partners visa. Honestly, we could have paid less and gotten better service with Carnival, it was that bad. I think the thing I’m most looking forward to at this point is sharing our full experience with our followers, I can’t recommend this cruise line to anyone.

I talked up virgin because of my last experience and talked my friends into spending their money and it was subpar. Instead of spending my birthday in Dominican Republic, I spent it trying to squeeze into other places on ship that were fully booked; adding further frustration. Then, I was unable to book an excursion because the app didn’t allow and then everything was sold out because of the last minute addition. To top it all off I was EMBARRASSED when I went to the bar and it was declined. I went to sailor services and was told that there was no card on file and I should her in Virgin’s app that said I had a card on file, and her responses was “well we don’t have one on file”. I had to walk all the way back to my room and back down to sailor services to get it added, wait while “finance ran my card” and incurred another $250 hold on my card. To say I’m disappointed is an understatement. Really did not enjoy my birthday because of this and nobody cares enough to make it right.

She shot him a bird and screamed the F word and kept yelling in his face that she works for Virgin, is with Talent, and she would have us removed by security. You can view the security cameras, we did nothing to this woman! We weren’t even standing near her. She came to us! We do not feel safe so we came to our room but I felt this needed to be reported particularly since she repeatedly mentioned she worked for Virgin Voyages in Talent. I do have her photograph as well. HDA- I am sorry to hear of this terrible behavior. This is not acceptable especially from crew. I will inform security. They will reach out to you and would request that you make a statement in person. The security will check cameras. Please do share photographs and any details you may have so that i can add this to your report. It is the blonde woman in the orange dress. I had to get a photo after we had gotten away from her because I was afraid she was going to hit me if I took one when she was close. She said she knows Richard Branson and we are nobodies so she is allowed to do and say anything she wants and she can stand anywhere she wants. If she is a Virgin executive like she says, that does not reflect well on the company.The brunette woman in black is with her but she did not say or do anything. HDA -Thank you very much for sharing. Would you like to meet with security? Yes. My husband would like to. But we aren’t going to leave the room again tonight. Maybe she will sober up before tomorrow. What can I do now about the sailor loot and bar tab that I haven’t used. I am afraid to leave my room and we had planned to go shopping and to the casino?if security can call or come here he would be glad to speak with them. I am sorry you are in fear, This is not right or fair to you that this woman has made you feel this kind of way. Our security will take care of this if you are willing to meet and make a statement. Security will meet you in Sailor Services on deck 5 mid ship. They cannot meet in the cabin in this case.

I am going to say it’s becusse if the infantile age of your cruise line. I called us missing Bimini days ago looking at the wind and weather forecast. You all as a cruise line should have done better. Putting the crew , and ship and guests at potential harms way is uncalled for. Never sail into a storm. And even if we could have docked in Bimini it would have been awful and flooded. So what is the point. You should have stayed off the coast of Cuba or more towards Mexico where there was a higher possibility of sunshine and better seas. Also so your crew didn’t have to scramble to get todays events going.I also hate that you could have planned better to not make an announcement and ask us up at 8 am in the room we come to sleep and not be disturbed. If I wanted to be disturbed I would have traveled with my children. Wake us up in the room at 8 am. You could have avoided this. Poor poor planning on virgins part. I don’t care it’s a sea day. I know why you couldn’t dock and understand it. But you could have planned and prepared better ahead of time. Disney even send their guests notice days before warning they will most likely not be docking at castaway. I guess that is what comes with experience. No shows during the day. Just places to spend more money. Shops and casino. And no sports area to watch basketball that isn’t in a echoing hall and crowded with trivia. It’s hard to find a lounge to sit and enjoy music with out of being 1000 decibels. And why why wake us up for this dreary day.

After the ruling, Sailor immediately said “that’s wrong”. He then got up and scanned WTP QR code we have for the TDA rules and began to look through the rules. Sailor then came up to the desk showing a google result for a rule that does not apply and said “See, I told you that you were wrong, you don’t know the rules”. 
After he was eliminated from the tournament, Sailor came over to the WTP room manager who tried to offer an explanation to him, took full ownership of the issue and apologized to him. Sailor proceeded to be nasty, and the WTP manager tried to defuse the situation, but the Sailor didn’t care and was intent on being loud and badgering the WTP manager for being wrong.
During his complaint to the WTP manager he said he was intent on leaving a bad review and wanted contact info of the person in charge.

We have questioned all parties involved from our side and from our point of view this could be a misunderstanding, 

The crew member that the sailors refer to is very helpful and he and the whole crew try and help ALL guest to done and remove the snorkel gear and hard life vests to avoid guests stepping or getting tangled on the straps,

While in the water, sometimes crew and guides pull guests from the hard vest since as you probably know, snorkel takes place in a high current environment and guests drift from the boat's ladder, but they always grab the vest and not the guests to prevent any misunderstandings,

Yesterday no one from our team received any complaint from the sailors in question, in fact, please see attached the comment form they left behind,

We understand and appreciate the sailors feedback and see how this actions could have been taken the wrong way, so we will have a refresher talk with all our team to emphasize the importance of making clear that their actions are directed to help the guests and to ask for permission at all times before they offer help to the guests either in or out of the water,

As for the refund, we will still maintain the offering, since one of our goals, after safety, is the sailors satisfaction,

Should you have any other question or concern regarding this matter, please let us know,'",03/28/24 ASTM Tobyn: Sailors have been refunded in full to their onboard account

Sailor was questioning the Gunbae dining concept and the fact he was left waiting for others to join his table since he is a single traveler.

During conversation sailor mentioned several times that he is from Jordan and not used to being treated in such a way (referring to negative answers regarding seating). Sailor then mentioned the issue with seating availability in Extra Virgin and that he was only offered seat on bar counter or high table which he didn't want.

Q: Quality of the food?, A: 2
Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: This is my second time sailing with Virgin, Scarlett Lady. The food is too exotic, doesn't have to be that exotic. It was generally bland as well. Not just in the Galley but everywhere. 

Secondly, this ship is full of varied age groups. Why do you play music only directed toward 20 somethings? It ridiculous amount of rap and club music. Some of us want classics and 80s, 90s, country and pop. 

I was also disappointed in how many activities were booked up and unavailable. 

Finally, it feel like the food is overly filling somehow. I'd eat a very small
Meal but feel like I just ate Thanksgiving dinner. It made me feel like there was a filler in the food or something. I rarely drink anymore, the drinks seem watered down, like a very low percentage of alcohol in them. 

Finally, why do you close all the bars down? There are areas of the boat that we would want to hang out in and my husband would have to go on a search to find a bar for beer several stories down. 

I don't know, it didn't feel like the same cruise second time around. 

Thank you for the NO single use plastic, very much appreciate that and wish everyone operated that way.
