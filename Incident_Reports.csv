Someone else’s underwear underneath the drawers in the closet| 

Ordered 3 romance packages (and paid for them) yet one was refunded bcuz they were oversold but never even notified us.|

Ran out of bubbly very quickly at the sail away party before we could even get a single glass of it to celebrate - we had been told previously that it would be served through the entire sail away party|

All fitness classes were completely sold out within hours - there really needs to be more options so others can also join|

Safety video was difficult to load and had to watch it multiple times before we got the option to confirm we have completed it - and even after that, it still shows as incomplete|

Shake for champagne did not work for several of our crew and customer service just responded to call room service to have it delivered but we shouldn’t have to be in our room - we were told we could order anywhere on the ship|

While off the ship in Key West on cellular, we could not access details of our trip in the app. Before the trip, we weren’t required to be on the ship’s WiFi (obviously) but once the cruise began, they only way we could access our account for information is to be on ship’s WiFi but that isn’t possible in Key West.|

Many of these things were marketed to us as to how VV is better than other cruise lines but it just makes VV seem worse than other cruise ships if they don’t work - bcuz it’s a high expectation that then becomes a frustrating disappointment.|

At the Festival Stage Acts the first night at the manor - we tried to order drinks at the bar and they told us we had to order at our table. It took forever for someone to come by to take drink orders and then she was a complete jerk when we were asking about the different drinks. I finally just told her forget it, just bring us water.|

Wake brunch was a disappointing experience - especially since we were there to celebrate several birthdays. The server we had (Giovani) never introduced himself and said “no” multiple times…asked for the full menu - no, asked for croissants - no. Didn’t get our first round of mimosas until the food started coming and didn’t get a refill until we were done eating. About 1/2 way through our meal, Giovani completely disappeared. Other staff served us through the rest of the meal but never metjoned or explained why our original server disappeared."""

This is because she is accompanied by two medical providers during her travels. Additionally, we were able to arrange for an umbrella to ensure her comfort. However, it is with great disappointment that we discovered the cabana we had reserved and paid for in January was unexpectedly canceled without any formal notice. While we understand that system errors can occur, it had a significant impact on our experience. I must emphasize that using Company V was initially a pleasurable experience, but it unfortunately marred our last day. Thankfully, my friend is doing well, but as a professional in the medical field, I strongly advise that any substantial purchases be given proper attention, as it is essential to consider unforeseen circumstances where additional care and support may be required. The fact that we did not received all that was promised to us was incredibly upsetting."" GSA then replied to the guest as follows: ""Thank you Sherma for sharing your detailed feedback with us.

Overall service was great and food quality for the most part was amazing. For the negative our room has constant creaking sound almost as if we were on board an old wooden ship. Though I understand this cruise is more on the ""party"" side, I was hoping there were dedicated relaxing areas (besides the spa) on the ship. Though there appears to be, it is ruined by the constant loud music at every corner of the vessel. It also makes it difficult to carry a conversation such as when at the pizza parlor. Razzel Dazzel was in line with the online comments I've read regarding sub par customer service. Which was odd because at Pink Agave was among the best I've had on any cruise line. The food there was also ""meh"" in comparison to food elsewhere on the ship. The main performances are only scheduled once rather than twice a night like other cruises which makes it even more difficult to schedule dining (its hard enough as it is). Lastly the ship layout is odd. I feel at times like I'm going through a corn maze. I've never seen anywhere where the men's and ladies bathroom are at opposite ends. I truly don't get the logic there and why areas are hard to get to/hidden throughout. I feel that for the most part there things can be easily fixed with training. But as of now it seems like this will be my last time at this cruse line. I appreciate the effort of providing a different take to the traditional cruise experience but there is definitely room for improvement."""

I waited patiently for about 20 minutes, but unfortunately, the servers seemed to be assisting other customers who arrived after us. My room mate and I were still waiting for someone to come and take our order. We received assistance only after I had to flag down a server. As we were finally served, we couldn't help but notice that others who arrived after us were helped immediately. I must confess that I experienced a certain emotional response. On other occasions, when we visited the sip lounge, Kenneth was the one who promptly assisted us. I'm uncertain about the necessity of training your staff to be more attentive to all customers (which is the impression I got), but it did leave a negative impression and made me have a negative experience at the sip lounge. My experience at the sip lounge would have been negative if it weren't for Kenneth's presence during my previous visits. Thank you Kenneth for ensuring that my time at the sip lounge was enjoyable.""// ""In addition, if I don't see Kenneth we will not be stopping at the sip lounge."""

I had Guest  Lisa approach the desk to express her frustration. Guest  explained that she had originally booked for herself and a group of 26 guests on Brilliant Lady but received a mail saying that because the ship is not ready they will rebook them on scarlet, many of her guests declined to guest onboard Scarlet only leaving 14 guests/8 rooms and as a result in this these rooms received more +-$800 in guest loot.

She explained that she was told that CC details need to be provided so that their tours can be ""held"" in order to reserve their shore things to ensure availability and once they arrive onboard they can your their SL to rebook the shore things, She requested to have the tours cancelled onboard and rebooked using their guest loot since it was given due to ""Company fault"" for cancelling their trip on Brilliant. I advised her that unfortunately we cannot cancel and refund pre booked tours and rebook them using their guest loot.

Lisa is not happy with the result as she booked and paid for the cruise for all of them and does not want the tours to be charged on their CC and were advised that it would not be.

Yes, we’re out at the moment! I’ve spoken to a few crew members about this, I’m looking for a quiet spot in the shade and it appears that no one can help me. the only place that is quiet and shaded is Richard’s Rooftop, but no one can help with access. this is the third day it’s been loud and too sunny for me to sit outside in peace, it’s very disappointing. GSA Cansu replied: ""Ahoy Jenna, the most quiet deck is deck 17, The Perch, back of the ship. I am sure that you can find peace in there. Guest  replied : ""No unfortunately both the perch and deck 17 are in full sun. I’ve checked both the back and front of the ship, we’re currently at The Dock and the music is blaring from the bar AND the shore. Is it possible to upgrade to get access to the quiet Richard’s Rooftop? My friends have sailed with virgin before and have been given influencer access to it, is that an option?

To do so, please just follow few easy steps on your Guest  App:

She didn't even check if anything was available or suggest we look in the app or even point us towards the dock or a different food venue. I'm definitely not expecting people to recognize us but the reason we walked down to The Wake was because we saw reservation at 12:30pm available and we didn't think it was a big deal to walk into the restaurant. I would probably have said something even if we was cruise on an inside room, Technically she wasn't rude, just unhelpful and unfriendly.""

I didn't quite understand her explanation. When she was washing my hair at the bowl, I told her I wanted colder water but it kept switching to hot water. She kept dropping tools and items on the bowl while washing my hair so it hurt my ears and gave me a headache. She pulled my hair and twisted my neck to different sides when she was blow drying my hair. I understand she is short and there are some restrictions but this experience was more uncomfortable than other blow out experiences. (I get them regularly, monthly at home).

Q: Tell us everything!, A: Having cruised with the company over the summer (Departure port: Athens) we were excited to come back. We are highly disappointed in this experience. Knowing we booked this cruise last minute (due to personal schedule) we haven’t been able to make any dinner reservations. We had success one night to make a “waiting list” at razzle dazzle, but were told by every other restaurant that they were booked for the week. This is unacceptable for the money paid and the experience that’s advertised.  It has made dinner a stress and unenjoyable. With this in mind, we went from raving about virgin to probably not cruise again with the company.

I had to go to customer service three times for issues with your app. It would not even play the safety video. Next up I bought one drink at the bar with no issues and then when I order a second one I’m told that I have to go back to customer service for a fourth time because there is a problem with my account. I’ve sailed on Norwegian three times and it was some of the most relaxing trips I’ve ever had.  I had nothing but complete stress the first two hours I was on this ship due to your technology failures. There is no way that you don’t know that this is an issue because your app rates 1.6 in the App Store. Everyone hates it.  At this point in my cruise I would never book Company again. I seriously hope conditions approve because I paid a lot of money for this vacation and so far it has been a complete disappointment. I considered getting off the ship before it left Miami because I was so stressed out.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: 1. We paid extra money for a sea terrace XL but these rooms don’t have the glass front to see the ocean, so I sit on my balcony and stare at a wall of metal. 
2. The rooms are RIGHT next to the mechanical room both next us and below us so we hear banging and loud noises-enough to wake you up from a dead sleep or keep you from sleeping. HORRIBLE ROOMS-and we paid MORE for them! I’m just so disappointed with them.
3. One of our rooms hadn’t been cleaned properly at all’s hair tie left in the shower from the previous people are no hand soap either. I had to track someone down no less than 4 times on our arrival day for different reasons and then had to call that night because the pillows I had asked for never arrived. 
4. The app has been terrible this trip. Wouldn’t work AT ALL the entire time we were in Miami so by the time it started working, tons of things were already sold outs so we had no opportunity to attend several things we had anticipated being able to enjoy while on the cruise. 
5. Many of the restrooms around the ship either had no toilet paper or were out of hand soap or the sinks didn’t work. 
6. There was no drag queen bingo onboard, which was our favorite activity from the last cruise. Not being able to see the lineup before you book just doesn’t sit will with me. Had I known this particular cruise was going to be all poker tournaments and no drag queen bingo, I never would have purchased this particular cruise. 
Overall-we LOVED our first cruise and couldn’t wait to get back on for our second cruise. After this one, I doubt that we will cruise again With VV. There are too many other cruise lines to try and this one just made us realize that so many others have better things to offer and have a higher level of customer service.

This is my third virgin cruise in two years. We’ve loved the first two so much that we’ve gifted future cruise vouchers to our family and friends to experience it themselves. More over, for my moms 60th birthday celebration, I saved up to take her on one this weekend. Unfortunately, if this trip had been my first virgin cruise, it would be my last. My mom gets motion sickness and is a light sleeper, and I told her that this ship would be great because it’s quiet and you don’t feel the motion. I wasn’t afforded an option to purchase a central terrace during booking and this was our only weekend we were available to go. Once receiving our room number I panicked. I was worried about the back of the ship and 8th floor for motion and the noise from the entertainment below so I tried to level upgrade to at least a larger room on a higher floor. By the time I received the room location, our flights were booked and my mom was ecstatic to finally take her first real vacation in years. So I decided to stay quiet and hope for the best. But regardless of that, for the price I paid to treat my mom, i have been embarrassed all weekend long by all of the things i had experienced in the past that i knew she would love and appreciate. I want to start by saying the crew, per usual has been amazing. David has tended to our every need. When We got in on day one, our room carpet was stained likely from a previous guest spilling food in drips, the mirror and roomet in room has residue smears, the people who stayed before us tore up wall and roomets, the lights on the wall were hanging down from the wall (I fixed). Our bed wall panel vibrated so loud with the ship movement (I have a video) that we couldn’t sleep in night one. I’m a big planner, and this itinerary was chosen because I had done it before and never had a problem feeling the ship move. Unfortunately, at the back of the ship even I have felt it and my poor mother does too. To add to my embarrassment, the music blaring from directly under our room in the Dock or the karaoke each night. I understand that this is fun for everyone but we haven’t been able to sleep before midnight any of the nights. My mom has been an angel telling me that it’s no big deal, but I know that it’s because I’ve paid for the entire trip and she doesn’t want me to feel badly. If I had known at time of purchase that our room location would be where it was, I would not have booked this trip. This is all to say I really believe it could be beneficial to your future guests to have the option to select their room if they aren’t doing a lock it in rate. I hope that this feedback proves beneficial. And if not, thanks for taking the time to read it anyway. Also, the internet is the worst it’s ever been. My network is consistently not working or able to connect to the app."""

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: Once seated, next to a bus station, a staff member spilled several plates right behind my husband.  There was no apology, nor did anyone check to see if spilled items hit his clothing.   Staff congregated at the bus station laughing and talking, not focused on how nearby diners were affected.  Dinner courses were delivered without clearing previous courses.  
Staff does not seem to possess ""situational awareness""
of the pacing of the dinner and just delivers whatever comes from the kitchen, without considering whether the previous course is completed.  Managers do not seem to be assisting or supporting (training) their staff.  This was our experience on the last two evenings, although our first dinner in Test Kitchen was flawless.  Thanks for asking.  We'd truly like to see service delivery improve.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: The romance package was misleading with the shake for champagne. Until we got on board we assumed you got champagne at any time each day. The treats only served on last 2 nights? We wanted our romance to start right away. The dinners were excellent food was great. The last night we scheduled as our special night. The only time we could do a show that was available was 10 pm and yep at 9 it was cancelled. No option to rebook as it was the last night. We the shows “selling” out this was very disappointing. The ap is awful. From day one of download through the entire cruise and when we asked about it we got a “yes, we know but it gets better when we are out at sea” well that’s a nope it doesn’t! Also telling us the are washing balconies during the cruise at 9:30 am was disappointing for us as we were going to sleep in that day since our tour was 2:30pm. Individually this issues were things you could overlook but all together made for a disappointing cruise.

Just wanted to inform you about a guest who did not want to turn over her prohibited item (Steamer).

Guest  insisted she went over the prohibited item list and the steamer was not on there. While the word ""steamer"" is not on there, it does say ""Any appliance with a heating body or element"". Although she was very upset about this, she later understood after explaining that it is a fire hazard.

Vazquez claims she waited over an hour for an answer on this prohibited item. I spoke to security about why it took so long to get assistance when I was available. They said they called their supervisor and then Ship security for assistance. I asked them to please contact me next time as well to expedite the response.

Vazquez also mentioned she has a very short window to make her flight on disembarkation day. She will be very upset if she misses her flight when trying to claim her item again.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: Overall, and my first experience of cruising, I don’t think I have been delighted with it. 

- breakfast wasn’t fantastic and didn’t quite know what was happening. I requested several items from the waitress, and they either came incorrect, or not what I ordered.
- on deck 16, during the day, the music was too loud and wasn’t offered a drink at all. Instead, had to go down to deck 15 every time I wanted a drink. 
- issues with credit card, despite being uploaded in advance and checked at checkin. When asked at Guest Services, the colleague had no clue as to what it could be. 
- went to Razzle Dazzle last night, and was completely lost with the menu. Didn’t know what was happening, or what was supposed to be received. Very little explanation on the menu, and it was just confusing overall - we were sitting on a table and all three tables to the right of us sent one course back, at least, for not liking it!!
- the general ‘attentiveness’ of service is not fantastic. For example, was in the Sip lounge, and had to wait 15 minutes for someone to take the order and that was only after calling someone over. Another example is the room wasn’t cleaned until c.midday. 

I recognise that, maybe, my expectations are not quite right. I, several times a year, stay in Company Limited Edition hotels, and having stayed in most of these, they different vastly from a virgin cruise - I wasn’t expecting this, as it is part of the wider ‘virgin group’ but recognise that, maybe, I shouldn’t compare.

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: Food is less than stellar and akin to military mess hall quality. There is a dearth of quality non-fru-fru dishes for the non-foodie. Astonished that VV won awards on the food quality. Dining reservations are difficult but there is no real choice as a food option for the non-foodie but nightly burgers or pizza. Each “specialty” dining option has left us looking for other options (again burgers and pizza). As a travel agent and blogger/podcast I have an issue recommending the main dining options. The Test Kitchen should be an experience not an other dining option. I’m underwhelmed as a whole regarding dining options and quality.

Pink Agavae was a highly recognised food venue and it lived up to my expectations ..But here on Scarlet they failed miserably. Although our staff was nice. The food was just not well prepared, it wasmt freshly prepared or hot...(luke warm at best) There just seemed to be too much going on with wayyyy to many staff moving around at the same time. I understand being busy and all. But we actually waited a very long time for our main course entree's, very tight seating arrangements the back of my chair was right by a supporting column which was also a high trafficked pass through and the back of my chair was bumped several times by patrons and staff. I applaude Pink Agave for attempting to accomodate guest but there were sooo many other spaces that had no activity at all that couldve been used to ""spread people out"" more. I also loved the musical vibe but the DJ just played it a bit too loud which caused diners to have raise our voices and people were basically talking over each other so that they could be heard

He said it wasn't relaxing massage because there people constantly going in and out of the bathroom and could here the noise of flushing toilets and water running and this ruined his whole massage experience and he feels that it wasn't fair as he has paid a lot of money for a relaxing massage but instead it was  horrible.

I was told I could file complaints here. Uhm. I don’t want to be that person, but I’ve interacted with Amin (the Hype) (Scarlet Lady) on the entertainment team multiple times on this cruise and he’s been awesome! But we interacted today after his dancing set on Bimini and he just made me uncomfortable. I’m an adult, but I’m 19– he knows this. He asked multiple times if he could see my tits and if I was a virgin and if I wanted to practice sex on the beach with him. He also pressed and asked if I sold nude pictures or if he could have them. He told my friend he was obsessed with me and in love with me. Which is fine. I’m not that distressed. It made me uncomfortable. But if y’all could just tell him— not to do that to others? He assured me he was joking but I don’t want the same thing to happen to others. Cheers."""

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: Food Choices are not appealing. Wanted to do a walk in at The Wake and was told we couldn’t get a table unless someone cancelled their reservation. That is not how you portrayed walk in dining. The beds are not comfortable. I Have gotten undercooked meals, bad service, and just a lack of service from some of the staff. The way you swap from breakfast to lunch is ignorant and not organized. This has not been a very appealing cruise and probably wouldn’t go on another one nor recommend to a friend. The resort we went to in Cozumel was littered with kids and the kayaks and snorkeling just not what was portrayed on the advertisement. Why does someone having type 2 diabetes that is controlled a problem to go “snorkeling” which was just swimming in shallow water with a life vest and a snorkel. Our original cruise was cancelled abruptly due to lack of planning on Yal part. Directions on the ship are horrible and very confusing due to the lack of signs. This has just not been a great trip for me and my wife. I had great service by a couple of your bartenders but other than that not so good.

I don’t know how anyone can walk out of those 2 shows and say “wow that was great”. The actors are all very talented, it is a shame to waste them. This is our 5th cruise with Company and at this point I am not sure I will return since the entertainment has remained so much the same. You guys need to do something to keep repeat guests interested. Duel Reality is great and worth the repeat viewing, the rest is hardly worth viewing once.

We spent the entire day mostly on the open-air truck ride to and from the location, only rode the ATVs 20 minutes, and was told we had to wait before and after riding because they didn’t have enough ATVs. There were almost 50 people signed up and they only had 16 ATVs so they divided the group by 3, they did this coin toss process to determine who had to sit around and wait. We left the port late, so everything thereafter seemed rushed. We were last to head back to the port and initially it seemed we wouldn’t make it back in time because we had to wait for group 3 to ride the ATVs and stop by a woman’s house for a few minutes for an espresso. Also, the helmets for our heads were not thoroughly cleaned and disinfected between users which exposes each people to communicable diseases and germs. I watched as people were directed off and on the ATVs, likely due to tight schedule, and a guy walked by and randomly sprayed a little Lysol inside, which is not supposed to go on things that we wear on our bodies, and did not attempt to clean the eye covering. On the truck ride back, we got stuck on the dirt road because cars and people attending a funeral blocked the road, so we were just sitting waiting and then the truck ran over a motorcycle which was stuck under the truck. Some local people got it out. There was absolutely no cellular reception so there was no way to alert the ship as to our location or what was happening. When we finally made it back, I realized we had been gone 6 hours for an excursion that was supposed to be 3 hours; the whole day was practically gone so we had no time to shop in D.R. as we needed to swiftly get back onboard the ship."""

Almost every meal had been served cold.

The clientele leaves little to be desired (though I realize this isn’t some the company can control). The fact there were swingers at the PJ party nearly having sex on the lounger my friends & I (and others) were on with crew walking by without saying anything is disgusting. 

Sadly, I’m an avid cruiser but will not sail with VV again. This has been a huge waste of money & loss of vacation time. I do believe the company should do some better marketing to allow those of us who might be considered “prudes” a better idea of how to set expectations.

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: This rating is about the Horserace painting/Ali the Artist, but there was no category for that so this was the closest. We’ve done the seahorse race multiple times before and both times with Ali have been subpar and awkward experiences especially compared with other Happenings Cast interactions. She has a standoff demeanor and makes it seem like the Guest s are inconveniencing her scheduled. Every other race we’ve done, the artist has offered two sessions or at least one two hour session. Here we were offered one one-hour session or to be sat on the side of a separate event. While I know this isn’t a directed session, other artists have made themselves available, offered some input and suggestions, or at least had fun and positive interactions during the session. She also maintained more of an authoritarian attitude during the painting and racing session than lighthearted fun. While our group wasn’t impacted, one group was a little late for the race coming from Drag Bingo and they were only afforded a few minutes to arrive (we were also told we could be a few mins late while the mock race was completed), yet the mock race and intros took close to 30 minutes. We’ve had very positive connections with other Happenings cast members over our 11 Company Voyages but Ali doesn’t seem to invite those interactions.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: Company Voyages has been my cruiseline of choice since 2021. I've cruised 7 times and booked two groups on Company. But I see things changing. I feel like you are becoming more like every other cruiseline. It use to be that every crew member would speak to you. Now not only do they not speak but they seem to always be annoyed. Of course there are exceptions but this now seems to be the norm. I have always raved about the food. Now not so much. Again, as the ships have gotten more towards capacity at cruises, your attempt to make it more efficient, you've made it feel like other cruiselines. The galley use to feel special in itself that you could walk around and view what selections were available, then sit down and be waited in. Now, while convenient and probably quicker, you stand in line, tell them what you want, and they prepare it and hand it to you when ready. New take on buffet. Then I made a reservation at the test kitchen after looking at the menu on the app for that evening only to get there and be told that that menu wasn't available until two days from then. I had tried this particular menu before and did not like it. So I was very disappointed. I would not have booked had I known. You also changed the menu at Razzle Dazzle. While there are those who like smoked flavor, it is an acquired taste. A few items are fine but it seemed that since it's in vogue, you want to make it the main flavor for most of the dishes. Smoked flavored cream burlee. Seriously! Next, you used to have excellent shows. Different, but that's what made them special. Now it seems like very little effort it put into them. I am so sorry that I sound so negative, but I loved everything about the Company Voyages Brand. So seeing you become more and more mainstream is disappointing. I loved how special I felt rather I was in a regular room or suite. I understand business, profit and stakeholders, but please don't forget Richard Brandon's vision for a casual luxury sustainable cruiseline.

Q: Are there any shows or activities that you would like to see that we don't currently offer?, A: Many of the shows weee not my cup of tea. Too many drag shows.
Q: Are you satisfied with the amount of shows and activities at night?, A: 1
Q: Are you satisfied with the amount of shows and activities during the day?, A: 2
Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: I paid for 3 hours at redemption spa and noticed I was charged for 6. I went Monday from 9-12. During that time there was no water available anywhere from 9-10:30. Considering you are in saunas and steam rooms that is dangerous. I was so dehydrated when I left. I was given a locker and no other instructions. I was traveling with a friend and she had our bar credits on her wrist thing so if I wasn’t with her I couldn’t drink and Tuesday night mine wasn’t even charged to hers it was charged to mine. This was not the cruise for me I guess. I thought having no kids would be great and relaxing but instead it was a frat party for four days. We went to the Test Kitchen for dinner. I’d have to say the worst meal ever. I didn’t stay for the entire thing. On the app what the menu was advertised was not what was served. I dont eat fish and my only other option was lamb which I don’t like. The app menu said it was beef. It was very uncomfortable for me. I realize the manager of the test kitchen was trying to help but I was insulted. He came to the table and said maybe this wasn’t for me and I could go to another restaurant. I say maybe if you had the right menu this wouldn’t have happened. Our room steward was wonderful as well as our server at blue agave. The one thing I was really hoping to do was the bungie workout. I tried to sign up as soon as I boarded at 2:00 and all the slots were already full.

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: There are too many bars on this ship and not enough quality restaurants.  We’ve been on many cruises, however this is the first Company cruise we’ve taken .. We SMELLED VOMIT on numerous occasions walking through the ship .  Obviously from people vomiting alcohol from being drunk .  The fact there are NO quality restaurants without making a reservation is unacceptable for us .  We could not get a reservation due to all of them being sold out nightly.  We felt ripped off quite frankly . You advertise Company as a higher quality experience but in reality you are actually cruise a floating bar so that you can bring in extra very lucrative bar bucks! You seriously need to rework the entire experience. Yes bars are fine but quality (and available) meals and entertainment are also an important part of the overall cruising experience. The hype on the scarlet night experience was a total disappointment.  We attended .. wore red and felt the whole experience was a bar crawl that was a total bore .  Dancing was minimal what we saw and we left .  The wedding was a bit strange . Some of the crew members were not trained in that realm and whole thing was amateur.  Disappointment is what best describes our experience on this ship .

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: This is our first Company cruise . We have sailed  Princess several times and  Celebrity and carnival cruises . Most of all the food and dining fall well below our expectations .  Our coffee every morning is never hot .   It’s just warm after putting our cream in it.  Room service is always booked as is this dining situation you have on this ship .  The food in the food court set up you have is below average from our experiences of dining on other ships.   When we wake up and can’t get a hot cup of coffee without having to purchase it at that coffee bar ..  it’s very annoying .  Last night we had reservations in Korean BBQ…  but we refuse to sit in group sitting so we left .  The fact that we pay high prices then are forced to sit with other passengers to dine is unfair .  We are non drinkers . Bring forced to sit with other passengers that are drinking heavily is not what we expect from booking this cruise .  We had to eat the Chinese food in the food court and the selection is pitiful and the sweet and sour chicken was slimy and gross .

It also said we could order ships eats menu items but the app would not load and we were not given a menu. We also weren’t shown any special retail items for purchase. If I had not just checked my bill I would have been overcharged by nearly $140. I am disappointed. I went and found a galley menu in the galley and carried my own food up without a tray. I then asked to buy a bottle of $30 Rose’ on the menu. I was told they don’t have that and I was offered a $49 bottle that I bought. On land that bottle cost $13. I was under the impression that renting a cabana was a luxury. It should have been much more seemless. I would appreciate the thermal spa charge removed and at least half the cabana rental charge removed as well."""

Must admit our final day on board was the best and if the entire experience had been at this level my opinion of Company Voyages would be very good, but unfortunately the first 3 days did not meet expectations. The Wake restaurant was however fantastic! Both the service and food were exceptional! If we had been able to get reservations at other restaurants onboard I think our opinion of the overall cruise might be completely different. The availability of seating in restaurants is wholly inadequate and needs to be addressed in the worst way. The food quality in the Galley is very institutional, and poor quality. Staff were helpful but this did not overcome the poor food quality. I know you have the ability to create quality food, I fount this at the Wake.

Now we have mothing planned for the entire day we are here.I asked where our excusion was going and no one could seem to answer that so that mu husband could find another way there.I just dont understand for the price we paid to be on a exclusive excursion and no one could come up to the room or ring our room. I didnt realize it was ship time and my phonr is an hour off. I went down to the excusion area right at 1130 which i thought was 1030. But they couldnt wait 2 minutes for us. The only 2 othet people going on this adventure. Which my phone is 1 hr off and said 1029 when i got there to the desk to ask if they could wait just 1 moment for us to run down but they left il us. And I'm not sure if your ship made announcement about the time change but people can't hear it in their rooms. . .

Booked excursion for Parafise Island today. Got to meet area & the port staff told us our group was there way too early & Company Voyages had messed up. It took me literally tapping this person on the shoulder because he was very frustrated & on cell say no bueno virgin cruises over & over to so.Many guests were waiting to here what was happening and he wasn’t answering. Then NIKOS who was very kind, explained the situation in detail. Nikos explained the tour would now leave at 230 instead of 1230 and back on ship at 730. We had reservations with friends book for a show & dinner so we couldn’t make that change. He said we would be refunded.Refunded isn’t enough really.can’t go to spa, reservations taken for food options today. Poolboacked when we came back to ship.have a torn meniscus so booked excursion that would pickup close to boat & drop back off & planned to take closest beach chair to drop off. Walking in Cozumel not an option. All or her excursions booked up. Basically very frustrated with this outcome & have a disappointed daughter whose trip this was for her 19th birthday. She begged for a virgin cruise. This is my 23rd cruise. I’ve never had an excursion fiasco like this one on any of my previous cruises. The whole thing was just really ODD & heartbreaking! Wish it would have been different & Cozumel would have beendoable at paradise beach excursion. Just wanted guest services to know so they can work on this mix up & the next guests won’t have to miss a day of cruising to a logistical mistake oneithervirfin or the excursion b. Vendor’s but as I said the vendor said over & over - no bueno virgin! I now tend to agree with him - NO BUENO VIRGIN!!!

Q: Tell us everything!, A: I am having a great time during the day but the time I lay my head down to the time I get up is absolutely horrendous. I can not even sleep longer than 2 hours of the non-real bed. The pillows are terrible and I have slept on couches that have felt better than the beds. And then I am in pain all day long because of the horrible night. I am in tear because of this. Everytime the boat sways my room door makes a knocking sound. This addition in the middle of the night is actually going to make me go insane.

Spa called Mrsa telling her that guest Erika will be down as a no show because she didn't turn up for her massage at 8am. Mrsa went to Guest s room and caught them leaving and informed Erika about her missed appoitment, Erika told Mrsa that her appoitment 9am and her husband's is at 11am. Guest s showed Mrsa the appoitments on their app which stated that it was at 9am and 11am. Mrsa called back the spa to inform them that its actually 9am Erikas appoitment, the lady from spa said no she booked 8am, which guest replied that when she was booking it came on the app 9am so she assumed that was her appoitment. Spa said she cannot have her quartz massage now she will only have the option to do a Swedish or deep tissue 50 mins , guest agreed as she needed one as she is suffering from her shoulder but she was not happy at all. Guest  booked in for quarts the day after (12th)  at 7:30am in the morning instead as thats the only time they had before her excursion so she would of have to be rushing. After speaking on the phone with the spa guest Joshua checked his app and whilst checking Erikas appoitment from the morning changed from 9am to 8am, but guest Joshua has screenshots from Erikas appoitment stating 9am. Guest  Erika was not happy and said surley they should compensate some how as this is not their fault at all."

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: We loved Duel Reality!!!!  I gave sad face because we would have liked to go to Red Party events tonight but our excursion was delayed, and instead of a “comfortable bus” we travelled to Chichen Itza and back in an INCREDIBLY cramped and uncomfortable van.  We were rushed through the excursion once we arrived because of the delay in starting, we didn’t even get to see the giant stone head ruin that is pictured on the advertisement.  It definitely was not worth the high price we paid and we lost an entire day of fun because we chose that excursion.  I couldn’t be more disappointed with how today went and now we are exhausted.  Why make the party on the same day as excursions are scheduled?  Very poor planning on Company’s part.  So we decided to stay in the room and order food which has been a fiasco.  First, the app would not work.  After much effort, we finally got ahold of room service through phone and learned that we can’t get fries with a burger and can’t get a real margarita on the rocks, only canned.  Very frustrating.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: See guest services complaint made at 120PM today. Excursion scheduled for Parafise island. Told when we met at appropriate spot that Company had made a mistake with vendor not telling us anything instead say virgin no bueno on cell phone over & over. Nikos cane to speak to group for excursion stating the tour would now leave at 230 & return at 730. We’d made dinner & show plans with friends so we couldn’t take that option. A refund was made but I sent to guest services a refund isn’t enough I put on & took swim attire & all other excursions were booked. So couldn’t really do what we wanted on shore. Said to guest services I had a knee problem so walking is difficult. Choose swim excursion so a boat was taking me & I could sit the whole day. Instead I got back to full pools. No reservations & no way to change all the plans made for day from 1130-600. Guest  services sent back forwarded to excursion group but zero contact from them & a notification guest services thread was closed. As I said I my chat to them: never have I had a go fused vendor & an excursion group who basically believe it was messed up - too bad so sorry. Har lived this cruise until today.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: The customer service and interactions with your crew has not been great. I like to cruise. This is my first Company cruise. Your staff has made me feel rushed and not welcoming. I know that’s not the intention you set forth when creating this experience. I’ve walked into a store and no one greets me. I made a purchase Monday and the clerk only spoke to tell me the total. 

Three times now I’ve been overlooked by staff in The Galley and someone else was acknowledged and served before me, even though I was there first. 

There needs to be some serious customer service/hospitality training. Please tell your crew to be kind and attentive to EVERYONE. This will probably be my last Company experience if I don’t see changes prior to Friday.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: I have been unable to book any dinner reservations starting from about 5 weeks before the cruise until today.  I am with a group and they invited me to dinner with them tonight, otherwise I was told nothing is available at all.  I went to the blue agave about 1:15 pm today since the hours for making dinner reservations was 9-2 I was surprised no one was there.  I asked guest services and they were unable to make any reservations, or provide any assistance at all.  have tried to walk in both nights of the cruise at multiple restaurants and was never called from the waiting list.  Your website and app say there is always tables left open for walk ins, this isn’t true.   The hostess at the Italian restaurant was very rude when I asked about reservations and told me there was never any time available.  It’s frustrating to the point that I considered flying home from Nassau tomorrow and would have done so but for the tour group I am with inviting me to dinner tonight.  On the first day of the cruise I waited in the reservation line for about 30 minutes before giving up.  Your process for dining in the restaurants is convoluted and difficult to navigate.   I am on a full comp from the casino and find the lack of assistance from anyone but my tour group to be zero.  It’s a shame because the embarkation process and  other staff I have encountered are extremely pleasant, as is my room and other amenities on the ship.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: The app is really frustrating. It takes forever to load, it kicks me out mid-use, my husband hasn’t been able to get it to work for 95% of the trip. The food situation is also frustrating. This is our first time with Company and we didn’t know that reservations for restaurants would be all booked up by the time we got onboard. All of the cruise info said that restaurants reserve some tables for walk-in’s but we’ve been first in line at opening twice and were told we could only get a table if someone canceled. Essentially we’ve paid for The Wake and got stuck eating in the galley. And the WiFi sucks.

I only have ever received the confirmation about booking the cruise within the last Sales with included a bar tab beginning from 150 $ if you book a sea terrace. We booked a sea view but I got assured that if we get the upgrade, we would get the bar tab as well. That’s why I am confused ??"". GSA answered: ""Ben, thanks for your patience. Unfortunately, as your original booking was The Sea View, we can't honor the Bar Credit because the promotion is not under the sea view room, but the Sea Terrace, even with the fact that you upgrade. I apologize for any inconvenience caused about this matter."" Guest  also mentioned that he is a bit frustrated as his proposal plans in Dominican Republic is not gonna happen.

I understand medical emergencies happen, however, it seems the decision to switch Nassau and how we have been pretty much stationary in the ocean is horrible. Second, I was charged for missing a HIIT class but I was there and the instructor didn’t check me in. The instructor told me to go to the front desk and they would remove the charge. I do so and the charge is still there. Third, the money for canceling my excursion didn’t go back to my card I used for purchase but instead went to my Company wallet.

There was a medical emergency this morning that required the sick guest to be evacuated by helicopter from the ship. As a result, we won’t be stopping at the DR.  We will go to Nassau instead. I don’t blame VV for the change in itinerary but it is disappointing.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: We won’t be booking Company again, and considering that many of our followers have expressed similar experiences we feel that this is nothing unique to us. We understand that emergencies may cause changes. But when a customer comes to you with questions about how these questions will affect their visa and you tell them that you’ll get back to them by a certain time, you get back to them. You don’t keep pushing them off and ignoring them, that’s just customer service 101. It’s sad because everything else has been amazing, but the customer service standards at Guest Services fails on ever level. We’ve wasted over $10k on this cruise simply because no one would answer our questions about my partners visa. Honestly, we could have paid less and gotten better service with Carnival, it was that bad. I think the thing I’m most looking forward to at this point is sharing our full experience with our followers, I can’t recommend this cruise line to anyone.

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: This trip fell well below the standard that I’ve come to expect from Company. This was supposed to be a trip for my birthday that I shared with my friends. I talked up virgin because of my last experience and talked my friends into spending their money and it was subpar. Instead of spending my birthday in Dominican Republic, I spent it trying to squeeze into other places on ship that were fully booked; adding further frustration. Then, I was unable to book an excursion because the app didn’t allow and then everything was sold out because of the last minute addition. To top it all off I was EMBARRASSED when I went to the bar and it was declined. I went to guest services and was told that there was no card on file and I should her in Company’s app that said I had a card on file, and her responses was “well we don’t have one on file”. I had to walk all the way back to my room and back down to guest services to get it added, wait while “finance ran my card” and incurred another $250 hold on my card. To say I’m disappointed is an understatement. Really did not enjoy my birthday because of this and nobody cares enough to make it right.

I was disappointed with our spa experience today. First- the large pool in the center had about 6 people who were very loud and treating it like being in a party hot tub. Not relaxing! Next- we had to wait about 25 minutes for our massages-the front desk person said she would tell the massage people that we were already in the spa- but she did not. We started 30 min late- but did get the full time. It wouldn’t have been so bad waiting if the spa atmosphere had been in place. GSA - Sorry to hear you did not receive a tranquil spa experience. I have informed the management of your experience and she will be in touch with you personally before the end of the cruise.

Q: Tell us everything!, A: On board experiences were terrific. Disappointed that we didn't get to enjoy the destination as advertised. The rumor that Company was trying to save fuel is disheartening. I do sympathize that there was a onboard medical emergency.  The alternative destination was not fulfilling or anticipated.  I am not privileged to all the information. I believe we could have made our port of choosing. In hopes that Company has  a way to make things right or provide better details for the change.

Then the credit cards weren't hooked up for a drink on sail away even though we were on the week before. All of the food has just been ok and definitely bland. The same food everyday over and over. After 4 or 5 days you are tired of it. We are waiting for something to blow us away but it hasn't happened. Comedy shows were repeated, food is bad.

We were in our room and the winds blew down a bar or something not safe we didn’t make a big fuss the app has been up and down since I booked and trying to book reservations in a timely manner but was unsuccessful but if you check your phone records of me calling trying to make me and my husband first anniversary special and it’s been nothing but people saying ohhhh if you get to the restaurant 30-45 min before you want to eat you can be seated because we have so many seats available for people with no reservations! If you look I kept calling saying it’s our anniversary and the one restaurant we really want to try was Korean BBQ and tomorrow is the last night and of course we’ve tried since we been on here and the rude person working tonight said ohhh we booked booked! Stressful because we’ve been told so many different things! "" // GSA YM answer: ""Ahoy Prisca, thanks for sharing your feedback. We’re sorry your experience didn’t match your expectations.

We went straight to guest services upon getting on the boat and asked about everything I had been calling about for weeks and was told the exact same thing about the restaurants 30-45min before but I digress because apparently you all were trained the same!"""

Q: Tell us everything!, A: Need more staff, need more bathrooms and trash cans throughout, change of plans was a disappointment but spa should honor prices for being in Bimini (not a sea day). First cruise for us, very hesitant to go on another one. Ship could use more direction and signs for restaurants/bars. More activities on sea days, more entertainment by the pool. Also could use more hot tubs. Not enough space to accommodate everyone. Leaving disappointed unfortunately

She shot him a bird and screamed the F word and kept yelling in his face that she works for Company, is with Talent, and she would have us removed by security. You can view the security cameras, we did nothing to this woman! We weren’t even standing near her. She came to us! We do not feel safe so we came to our room but I felt this needed to be reported particularly since she repeatedly mentioned she worked for Company Voyages in Talent. I do have her photograph as well. GSA- I am sorry to hear of this terrible behavior. This is not acceptable especially from crew. I will inform security. They will reach out to you and would request that you make a statement in person. The security will check cameras. Please do share photographs and any details you may have so that i can add this to your report. It is the blonde woman in the orange dress. I had to get a photo after we had gotten away from her because I was afraid she was going to hit me if I took one when she was close. She said she knows Richard Branson and we are nobodies so she is allowed to do and say anything she wants and she can stand anywhere she wants. If she is a Company executive like she says, that does not reflect well on the company.The brunette woman in black is with her but she did not say or do anything. GSA -Thank you very much for sharing. Would you like to meet with security? Yes. My husband would like to. But we aren’t going to leave the room again tonight.

I am going to say it’s becusse if the infantile age of your cruise line. I called us missing Bimini days ago looking at the wind and weather forecast. You all as a cruise line should have done better. Putting the crew , and ship and guests at potential harms way is uncalled for. Never sail into a storm. And even if we could have docked in Bimini it would have been awful and flooded. So what is the point. You should have stayed off the coast of Cuba or more towards Mexico where there was a higher possibility of sunshine and better seas. Also so your crew didn’t have to scramble to get todays events going.I also hate that you could have planned better to not make an announcement and ask us up at 8 am in the room we come to sleep and not be disturbed. If I wanted to be disturbed I would have traveled with my children. Wake us up in the room at 8 am. You could have avoided this. Poor poor planning on virgins part. I don’t care it’s a sea day. I know why you couldn’t dock and understand it. But you could have planned and prepared better ahead of time. Disney even send their guests notice days before warning they will most likely not be docking at castaway. I guess that is what comes with experience. No shows during the day. Just places to spend more money. Shops and casino. And no sports area to watch basketball that isn’t in a echoing hall and crowded with trivia. It’s hard to find a lounge to sit and enjoy music with out of being 1000 decibels. And why why wake us up for this dreary day. It could have been handled last night!!"

Q: Not finished? Tell us everything!, A: This is my second time cruise with Company, Scarlett Lady. The food is too exotic, doesn't have to be that exotic. It was generally bland as well. Not just in the Galley but everywhere. 

Secondly, this ship is full of varied age groups. Why do you play music only directed toward 20 somethings? It ridiculous amount of rap and club music. Some of us want classics and 80s, 90s, country and pop. 

I was also disappointed in how many activities were booked up and unavailable. 

Finally, it feel like the food is overly filling somehow. I'd eat a very small
Meal but feel like I just ate Thanksgiving dinner. It made me feel like there was a filler in the food or something. I rarely drink anymore, the drinks seem watered down, like a very low percentage of alcohol in them. 

Finally, why do you close all the bars down? There are areas of the boat that we would want to hang out in and my husband would have to go on a search to find a bar for beer several stories down. 

I don't know, it didn't feel like the same cruise second time around. 

Thank you for the NO single use plastic, very much appreciate that and wish everyone operated that way.
